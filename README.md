# Check_Armstrong_Number
This is a C++ Project code to check if a number given by user is an armstrong number or not. 

WHAT IS ARMSTRONG NUMBER :->

An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number or plenary number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the total number of digits in the number.

Example:

Let's take the number 153.

Count the number of digits: There are 3 digits.
Raise each digit to the power of 3 (the number of digits):
1 
3
 =1
5 
3
 =125
3 
3
 =27
Sum the results:
1+125+27=153
Since the sum (153) is equal to the original number (153), 153 is an Armstrong number
